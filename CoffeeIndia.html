					Coffee came to India, through a Saint named BABA BUDAN, Baba Budan while on a pilgrimage trip to MECCA, tasted this elixir, and carried a few coffee beans along with him. This was planted at Baba Budan Giris a hilly region in CHICKMAGALUR, Karnataka and thus started its journey, sometime in the early 19th century. Coffee is a plantation crop and is grown in the Western Ghats. Karnataka is the largest producer of coffee with 65% share, next is the state of Kerala with 25%, 5% from Tamil Nadu and rest from Non Coffee growing Areas like Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh, and a few in North Eastern states of Nagaland and Meghalaya.

The raw coffee was roasted in the night and early in the morning the roasted beans where ground using a HAND OPERATED stone grinder. With freshly drawn milk from the COW, this drink was enjoyed by every family. </p>
