						In the dry method, the harvested red cherries are spread in large patios and Sun dried in the original form. Periodically, they are turned around to avoid any fungus formation which can affect the cup quality. The cherries are dried for a fortnight. The fully dried cherries when shaken give a rattling sound. Another way is to take a hand full of dry coffee cherries which are weighed for 2-3 days and if there is no weight change, this is an indication that they are thoroughly dried. This cherry coffee is hulled to remove the skin and finally we call this coffee as cherry coffee. Where there is shortage or insufficient water, this method is followed. Cherry coffee is graded in the same way as parchment coffee. Cherry coffee is just shady green with a silver skin around the bean. The cherry coffee cup quality is smooth with sharp acidity and full flavour but make a light body. They are very useful for blending with other grades and make a very good cup.</p>
						<p style="text-align:center"> Robusta coffee is processed in the same way as with Arabica. Robusta coffee cup quality has a strong aroma, with sharp acidity, medium to strong body. Blending with Arabica in small percentage makes a Very good cup. </p>
						<p style="text-align:center"> Monsooned coffee is very special to India and we have a real story through which it got this name. A few decades ago a consignment of coffee was shipped to Europe by sea. En-route to its destination because of cyclone, the ship was anchored till the monsoon retreated. During this period, the coffee absorbed the moisture from the air and they changed colour to straw yellow. The coffee, when landed in Europe, tasted just different than usual and they were delighted with this unique flavour and aroma. They named this coffee MONSOONED COFFEE. Now we prepare this kind of coffee during south west monsoon. Especially the Arabica Cherry coffee is spread on patios in warehouse in the Malabar Coast. During this period they absorb the moisture and turn straw yellow. This special variety of coffee is usually exported for higher price hardly available or consumed in India.  </p>
						<p style="text-align:center"> Many small planters if they do not have facility to process the coffee in the above method sell the raw coffee to Coffee Curing Works who have high technology automated process Grading and Sorting machines. These machines use sensor and colour sorters to remove faulty and damaged beans like BITS, BROWNS and BROKENS. </p>
